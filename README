Project Tutorial:
-----------------
NOTE: This package requires an installation of openni_tracker and sound_play. Both of these packages may be found in http://www.ros.org/wiki/.

To Run:
Each in separate terminals,
$ rosrun sound_play soundplay_node.py
$ rosrun openni_tracker openni_tracker
$ rosrun body_scanning body_scanning.cpp

Given published transforms (/tf) for each body part, this node will interpret the data into the height, distance, and recent movement of the user for audio output.
